# Bike Investment Dashboard

### Executive Summary:

This project uses clean sales, profit, and customer demographic data to guide product and market decisions for a bicycle startup.
Data was analyzed and visualized using Power BI, leveraging Power Query for data preparation and DAX for calculations and measures.
The analysis focuses on identifying the most profitable categories, sub-categories, and target markets.
Insights provide strategic guidance for maximizing revenue and growth. I recommend these actions to maximize profitability and target the right customers and markets:

1. Focusing first on Mountain Bikes in the US and Canada.
2. Expanding into Road Bikes and Accessories after initial market success.
3. Aligning marketing efforts with peak season (Q2).
4. Targeting the male adult demographic (average age 37) for initial campaigns.

#### Business Problem:

A new bicycle startup needs to identify the most profitable product categories and sub-categories while targeting the right markets and customer segments. With limited resources, the company must decide where to invest first to maximize revenue, growth, and market share. The challenge is to analyze sales, profit, and customer data to guide strategic decisions on products, geographic markets, and marketing efforts, ensuring efficient allocation of resources for maximum return.

#### Methodology:

1. Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured sales, profit, and customer data using Power Query.
2. Analysis & Metrics: Created key calculations with DAX to evaluate revenue, profit, and trends.
3. Dashboard Development: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with pages for Overview, Bikes vs Accessories, Sub-Category Choice, and Choice Understanding.
4. Insights & Recommendations: Identified profitable categories, growth opportunities, and target markets to guide strategy.

#### Skills:

1. Data Analysis & Transformation: Power Query for cleaning, shaping, and preparing datasets.
2. Data Modeling & Calculations: DAX for creating metrics, measures, and aggregations.
3. Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Power BI to design interactive dashboards and reports.

#### Results & Business Recommendation

The analysis shows that the Bike category is significantly more profitable than Accessories, generating 10 times more profit despite lower order quantities. While Accessories display a declining trend, Bikes show consistent growth and renewable revenue. Within Bikes, Mountain Bikes demonstrate strong growth potential, recently surpassing Road Bikes in profit, while revenue-to-cost ratios remain similar. The primary target markets are the US and Canada, focusing on male adults (average age 37), with Q2 identified as the peak season for demand. Key products selected for the initial strategy include Mountain-200 Silver 45, Mountain-200 Silver 38, and Mountain-200 Black 46. I recommend these actions to ensure strategic investment, optimize product selection, and make the most of market opportunities:

1. Prioritizing Mountain Bikes in the US and Canada to leverage current growth trends and maximize early revenue.
2. Gradually expanding into Road Bikes and Accessories to diversify the product portfolio once the core market is established.
3. Timing marketing campaigns and promotions around Q2 to capitalize on peak seasonal demand.
4. Tailoring strategies to the male adult demographic to increase engagement and conversion rates in the target market.

#### Next steps

1. Analyze customer behavior and feedback to optimize products and marketing.
2. Monitor market trends and competitor performance to spot opportunities.
3. Apply predictive analytics to forecast demand and guide investment decisions.
